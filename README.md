# Hi there 👋

I’m **Nico Angelo**, a curious learner who’s exploring the world of **web development**, **app development** and **cybersecurity**.  
I enjoy building small projects, experimenting with different technologies, and picking up new skills along the way.  

#

### </> About Me
- 💻 Currently learning and improving my skills in **full-stack development** (with a focus on backend + frontend basics).
- 🔨 Exploring modern stacks like **PERN** and **Django** to build scalable and dynamic applications.
- 🔐 Interested in **cybersecurity, backend systems, and how the web really works under the hood**.  
- 🚀 Working with tools and technologies like **Python**, **Node.js**, **Express**, **React**, and constantly experimenting with new tech.  
- 🎯 My goal is to keep growing, break things (in a good way), and learn from the process.
- 🎮 When I'm not coding, I play video games in my free time.
