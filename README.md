## About Me
I'm an IT student with a strong passion and hunger for improvent in programming. I'm currently expanding my skills by learning full-stack development with technologies like React, Express.js, and MongoDB. I also have experience working with Node.js, Flutter, and Arduino through personal and academic projects.
